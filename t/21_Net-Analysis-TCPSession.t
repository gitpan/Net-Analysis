=head1 HOW TO ADD A NEW TEST FILE

Half of this st of tests steps very carefully through a simple TCP session.
The other half attempt to extract the monologues from various TCP capture
files, comparing results with some reference monologues generated by
ethereal/wireshark.

If you want to add a new TCP capture test case, this is what you need to do ...

First get a tcp capture file that contains the session you want. It shouldn't
contain any other packets or sessions, so use etheral/wireshark or tcpdump
filters to reduce it down.

Then load it into ethereal/wireshark, and use the 'view session' option to
display the TCP session as a series of red/blue monologues.

Now save this in hex-mode from ethereal/wireshark. This is considered the
'reference' version of the monologues derived from the TCP session, which
TCPSession.pm should match.

Add the capture & hex-dumped files as

 t/tN_descrip.tcp
 t/tN_descrip.hex

using the next value of N, and a short descrip of what characteristics this
trace contains.
