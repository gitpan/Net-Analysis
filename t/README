Steps on adding a new TCP capture file ...

 * Give it a useful filename (e.g. t/tNN_description.tcp)
 * Load it into ethereal, and right click the 'assemble TCP stream option'
 * select the 'hex dump' option
 * Save the assembled stream as t/tNN_description.hex
 * Checkin both of the t/tNN_description.{hex|tcp} files

This means that (so far) each capture file can only contain a single TCP
session. You can also use ethereal to save the raw TCP data into a new file
if your original capture has multiple sessions.

Now when you run the test-suite, they'll be automatically picked up. And
maybe even pass :)
